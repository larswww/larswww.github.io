This is my portfolio page for projects created as a student at [Webbprogrammerare 120hp] with [Linnaeus University]. This program is 
location independent and I'm currently studying from my apartment in Shanghai. 

I'm originally from a small town in [Jämtland] and the internet opened my world. Me participating in the program is due to a long interest in the internet and a desire to create things for it. I like 
learning new stuff independently and believe online/distance learning using technology will transform traditional education. 

I've previously studied Chinese with [复旦大学] and online with [Dalarna University]. As well as here and there during my 10 years in China.
